去年年底开始，国产大戏 —— 动画版《三体》上线，激起一波高潮。6 集之后，流量和话题出现断崖式下降。新年到来，上海美术电影制片厂用一部《中国奇谭》刷新了历史高度。口碑流量双丰收，深得年轻观众的青睐。目前只更新了三集，豆瓣评分就高达 9.5，相比之下，《三体》只有 4.8 的成绩。

第二个故事《鹅鹅鹅》多数观众直呼看不懂。我看了两遍，然后去追了原著《阳羡书生》，才理解了个大概，被古人克制的留白深深折服。我还没见过一个故事是不输出价值观的，只是非常冷静客观地记录故事，一句评价都没有。不只是作者没有评价，就是主人公阳羡书生，全篇也就直说了一个字，“善”，对自己的所见所闻不做任何评论。

舆论再发酵一会儿，出现了中国家长对该动画的不满，认为《鹅鹅鹅》不利于孩子的健康，我不以为然。我看的时候邀请了我的小孩，即使第一集《小妖怪的夏天》这种少儿适宜的动画，我娃也只是瞟了一眼，然后说我不喜欢，就去玩别的了。如果家长觉得孩子不应该看，可以不给看嘛，谁规定动画片就是给小朋友看的呢？

这么好的故事，如果不宣传一下给客户那岂不是浪费了。之前讲给客户的，都是儿童故事，深感对不起客户。所以翻译了一下原著《阳羡书生》，讲给了客户。这种题材的难度太高，客户的接受度不好，下次还是换个题材的好。

以下是讲稿：（部分文字来自谷歌翻译，惊奇地发现，谷歌居然连古文都能翻译成英语，真的匪夷所思！）

中国奇谭，又叫 Chinese Folktales. It is the most popular cartoon nowadays in China. You can watch it on [bilibili.com](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/media/md28235401/). I strongly recommended everyone have a look.

The second story is Three Geese or Goose Mountain. It's very interesting. The idea came from the original Chinese folktale. Today I will tell you this original story. Not the second one, there are different.

There was a delivery man, who delivers goose to Goose Mountain. One day, He met a man on the side of road. He claimed that his feet hurt and asked him to stay in his goose cage. The delivery man thought he was joking, But that man got into the cage. The delivery man carried the cage on his back, but he didn't feel that the weight was getting heavier.

And later, The delivery man went to rest under a tree. That man then walked out of the cage and said, "I want to make a meal for us." The delivery man said, "Good." That man spit out a box from his mouth. The sea and land in the box are rare, delicious food, very rich. After drinking for three rounds, that man said: "I originally took a woman with me, but now I want to invite her to have dinner with us." The delivery man said: "Okay.". That man spit out a beautiful woman from his mouth. She sat down to eat with them.

After a while, that man got drunk and fell asleep. The woman said: "Although I am married to him, I don't love him with all my heart. I also secretly brought a man with me. Since he has fallen asleep, I will temporarily call him out. Please don't tell him. ". The delivery man said: "Good." The woman spit out a man, He is very smart and handsome. They were drinking together.

After a while, the woman got drunk and fell asleep. The man said: "Although this woman has affection, my heart is not entirely on her. I also secretly took a woman with me, and now I want to meet her temporarily, please don't reveal it." The dilivery man said: "Okay .” The man spit out another woman from his mouth. They drank together and talked for a long time. 

And later, Hearing the first man's movement, the man said: "They are awake." So he took the woman into his mouth again. And the woman awaked and took the man into his mouth. Then the first man got up and took the woman into his mouth.

Only one large copper plate was left, which was about two feet in size. The scholar bid farewell to Xu Yan and said, "I have nothing to give you, let me leave this as a gift for you."

Later, the delivery man found that copper plate was made 300 years ago.
