In tradition, People think if one man died, he must drink a soup named MengPoTang that will make him forget everything. And then, He will be born again and have a new life. so every one has a lot of previous lifes, but unfortunately we often cannot remember that.

Our story starts from their previous life. A shepherd boy saved one small white snake from a man making a living by catch snake.

1700 years later, Shepherd boy becames handsome boy, and catch snake man becames buddhist monk. the small white snake becames huge white snake :), it has magic and becames beautiful girl.

How to talk with a girl and start new relationship? The best way in China is to lend her an umbrella, Xuxian is good at this.

They fell in love when they met and then get married. After married, they worked as docter and saved a lots of people's life.

Why people can fall in love at first glance? It's an easy question in our story, because they have story in their previous life. Xu xian helped White snake skip, and White snake also wants to repay. Live is magical feelings that can kept in thousand yeas, hate is also. Fahai doesn't forget their story, he want to revenge. So fightings between Fahai and the couple is comming.

* Round one: One day, Fahai met Xuxian and told him "Your wife is a snake", But Xuxian said: "No, My wife is a human being!". "Do you dare to drink realgar wine to her?", "Yes". And then, White snake drinks realgar wine and becomes the huge white snake. Xu xian was scared to death. At last, White snake steals ganoderma grass and saved her husband back.

* Round two: Another day, Fahai met Xuxian again and asked him "You wife is snake, Do you believe it now?". Xuxian said: "Yes, I konw but I don't care!". So Fahai locked Xuxian in Jingshan temple. White snake cannot find her husband so she got the water filled the temple. And then, she got her husband back home.

* Round three: At this time, Fahai met Xuxian and didn't say anything. He locked White snake to Leifeng Tower directly. Because in last fighting, the water made a lot of people die.

Xuxian has no magic and cannot save her wife. Until her son grow up and get top one in national examination and saved her mother back. Since then, their family has had a happy life.
