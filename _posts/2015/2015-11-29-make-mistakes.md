- Do you want to know the difference between a master and a beginner?

      The master has failed more times than the beginner has tried.

- We need to think about failure differently.
  
      Most people think mistakes are a necessary evil. Mistakes are not necessary evil, they aren't evil at all. They are an inevitable(不可避免的) consequence of doing something new and as such should be seen as valuable.
